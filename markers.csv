Zebras,"Chapman's zebra are social animals, living in large herds. They mix freely with groups of other grazing animals such as wildebeest. Together they form an effective early warning system against predators, such as lions and hyenas.  The stripes are thought to confuse predators; in a herd of zebra it is difficult for a hunting lion to see the outline of an individual zebra â€“ the stripes seem to merge across several animals, known as 'disruptive colouring'.","51.5355,-0.1579",images/popups/zebra.jpg,images/markers/zebra.png,"into africa, african"
